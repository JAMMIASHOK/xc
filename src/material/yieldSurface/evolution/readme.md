The kinematic hardening models are intended to simulate the behavior of materials that 
are subjected to cyclic loading. 

Evolution equations for constitutive models describing the behavior of a 
material under cyclic loading processes.


Kinematic hardening: the yield surface translates.
Isotropic hardening: the yield surface dilates.
