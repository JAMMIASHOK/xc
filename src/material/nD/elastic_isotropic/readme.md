Elastic isotropic material
==========================

N-dimensional elastic isotropic materials.

The properties on an elastic isotropic material do not vary with direction. Isotropic materials therefore have identical Young modulus, Poisson's ratio, thermal expansion coefficient, etc. in all directions.
