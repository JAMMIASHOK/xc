# Finite deformation

Hyperelasto-plastic (finite deformation elasto-plastic) materials.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_strain_theory): in continuum mechanics, the finite strain theory—also called large strain theory, or large deformation theory—deals with deformations in which strains and/or rotations are large enough to invalidate assumptions inherent in infinitesimal strain theory. In this case, the undeformed and deformed configurations of the continuum are significantly different, requiring a clear distinction between them.
