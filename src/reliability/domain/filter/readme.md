Two principally different methods of creating realizations of random processes are currently implemented in OpenSees(XC). The first method is used in conjunction with sampling techniques to generate realizations of a random process based on a pre-defined power spectral density (PSD) function. The second option involves the specification of a filtered and modulated white noise process, which can be used in FORM analysis to estimate the mean out-crossing rates of selected response quantities.

The classes in this directory implement the object that can be used to filter the white noise process.
