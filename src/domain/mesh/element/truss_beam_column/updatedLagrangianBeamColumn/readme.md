# Updated Lagrangian beam elements

The Updated Lagrangian elements take into account the so-called member P-delta 
effect (or little delta effect), whereas in the formulation of the "Corotational" beam/column element only second order effects associated with displacements at the end of the members are considered (often referred to as structure P-delta effect or big delta effect).
