\noindent {\bf Description}
\indent FileDatastore is a concrete class. An FileDatastore object is
//! used in the program to store/restore the geometry and state information 
//! in the domain at particular instances. This information is stored in
//! binary form in files. As no standard format is used for the storage of
//! integers and double values, files used to store the data on one type
//! of machine, may not be read by a FileDatastore object on another type
//! of machine where the storage of integers and doubles is different.

//! For each of the base relations, i.e. Domain, Nodes, Elements,
//! SFreedom\_Constraints, MP\_Constraints, NodalLoads and ElementalLoads, a
//! separate file is used to store the information. Files are also used
//! for each size of ID, Vector and Matrix stored. At present, Messages
//! are not stored, only ID and Vector objects of size \f$<= 200\f$ can be
//! stored, the max \f$noRows * noCols\f$ of Matrices that can be stored
//! is \f$<= 2000\f$, and only a single relation is created for Matrices which
//! have similar sizes but differing dimensions. The data is stored in the
//! files following the schema outlined previously.

\noindent {\bf Constructor}
\indent {\em FileDatastore(char *name, Domain \&theDomain, FEM\_ObjectBroker \&theBroker);} 
//! Opens the files for the domain and base component relations, files have names {\em
//! name.relation}, and stores the end of file locations. Creates three arrays
//! of file pointers for the ID, Vector and Matrix files and then zeros
//! these arrays. If the files could not be opened, or there is not enough
//! memory for the arrays an error message is printed and the program
//! is terminated.

\noindent {\bf Destructor}
\indent {\em virtual~ \f$\tilde{}\f$FileDatastore();} 
//! Each file that is opened is closed and the arrays of file pointers
//! obtained from the heap in the constructor are returned to the heap.

\noindent {\bf Public Methods }
\indent {\em int buildFE\_Model(void);} 
//! To build the finite element model from data in the database. It does
//! this by invoking {\em restor(0)} on itself.

\indent {\em int getDbTag(void);}
//! Increments the integer containing the current dbTag and returns this
//! integer.

\indent {\em int validateBaseRelationsWrite(int commitTag); }
//! The object first checks to see if the Domain has already been
//! committed to the database with a similar \p commitTag. If it has, a
//! check is made to ensure that the current domain stamp and the one at
//! the time of this last commit are the same. If they are different, an
//! error message is printed and \f$-1\f$ is returned. A check is then made to
//! see if the component base relations have been updated for this current domain
//! stamp. If they have not been the base relations are updated, and each
//! domain component is asked to send its data to the database. Finally
//! the Domain relation is updated with the current time, load factor and
//! domain stamp. Returns \f$1\f$ if the component base relations needed to be updated
//! and the component information sent, \f$0\f$ if just the Domain relation
//! needed to be updated. A warning message and a negative number is
//! printed if an error occurs.


\indent {\em int validateBaseRelationsRead(int commitTag); } 
//! The object first obtains from the Domain relation the information for
\p commitTag. If no information exists, an error message is printed
//! and a \f$-1\f$ is returned. A check is then made to see if the domain
//! stamp for this entity and the Domain objects current stamp are the
//! same. If different, clearAll() is invoked on the Domain, and
//! from the component base relations new domain components are created,
//! are asked to recvSelf() from {\em *this} and these new
//! components are added to the Domain. Finally the current time, domain
//! stamp and load factor are set using the information in the entity. 
//! Returns \f$1\f$ if the domain needed to be cleared and new component
//! objects created, \f$0\f$ if just the Domain object needed to be updated
//! with current time and load factor. A warning message and a negative
//! number is printed if an error occurs.

\indent {\em char *addToProgram(void); }
//! Returns \f$0\f$.

\indent {\em int setUpShadow(void);}
//! Returns \f$0\f$.

\indent {\em int setUpActor(void);}
//! Returns \f$0\f$.

\indent {\em int setNextAddress(const ChannelAddress \&otherChannelAddress);}
//! Returns \f$0\f$.

\indent {\em ChannelAddress *getLastSendersAddress(void);}

\indent {\em int sendObj(int commitTag,

\indent {\em int sendMatrix(int dbTag, int commitTag,

//! First determines the size of the matrix, \f$noRows * noCols\f$. If a files
//! for matrices of this size has not yet been created, one is created now
//! and the cell in the array of file pointers is set. If file can not be
//! created a warning message is printed and program is terminated. A sequential search
//! is made in the file to see if information is already stored for a Matrix with
//! this \p dbTag and \p commitTag. The data is then written at this
//! location, or eof if no location was found. The end of file location
//! for Matrices of this size is updated. If successful \f$0\f$ is
//! returned. A warning message and a negative number is returned if the
//! operation fails: \f$-1\f$ if Matrix size is too large.
