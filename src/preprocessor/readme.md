Tools that generate the FE model (mesh, constraints, loads,...):

  - multi_block_topology: geometric entities that define the block topology model (k-points, lines, surfaces and blocks).
  - set_management: routines to manage model component sets (nodes, elements, k-points, lines,...)
  - prep_handlers: objects to interact directly with the model entities containers (node container, element container, load container, sets container, ...).
