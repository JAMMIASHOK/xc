# Two-dimensional topology blocks

This directory contains quadrilateral surfaces `QuadSurface.h` and polygonal surfaces `PolygonalFace.h`. Those objects can be uset to generate meshes of quadrilateral finite elements.

Examples of use of those objects can be seen in `verif/tests/preprocessor/meshing`.
