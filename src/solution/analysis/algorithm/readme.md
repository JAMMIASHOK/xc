Solution algorithms
===================

Objects that find the solution from the last time step to the current one. There are algorithms for eigenvalue problems (standard, linear buckling, frequencies,...) and for linear and non-linear systems of equations (Newton-Raphson, Line search, Krylov-Newton, Linear,...). There are also domain decomposition algorithms.
