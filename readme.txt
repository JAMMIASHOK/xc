Open source finite element analysis program designed to solve structural analysis problems. The program is based on:

- Python: user's programming language (boost.python interface with OpenSees based C++ kernel).
- OpenSees: finite element analysis routines.
- VTK: visualization routines.
- CGAL: computational geometry routines.
- NumPy: numerical computation.
- SciPy: scientific computing tools for Python.
- LaTeX: document typesetting.
- matplotlib: plotting all kind of math related figures...


The main capabilities of the program:

- Geometry modeling and mesh generation tools.
- OD, 1D, 2D and 3D elements.
- Linear and non-linear analysis, static and dynamic.
- Fiber section models (modelization of RC members,...).
- Activation an deactivation of elements (construction phases,...).
- Tools for implementing structural codes (Eurocodes, ACI, AISC,...) verifications (in progress...).
- Interface with Salome (in progress...).
- Interface with SCIA Engineering (in progress...).
