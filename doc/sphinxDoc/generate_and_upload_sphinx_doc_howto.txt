Make sure you have installed the python-sphinx package


First we search for the sphinxDoc directory:

cd .../xc/doc/sphinxDoc

Then we create the html files:

make html

We change to our local XCmanual repository

cd /usr/local/src/prg/XCmanual

and update the newly created/updated files:

sh update.sh

finally we push this repository into GitHub as usual.

The result can be seen here: https://github.com/xcfem/XCmanual/
