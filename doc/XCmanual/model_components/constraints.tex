\section{Constraints}
In a finite element problem, the boundary conditions are the specified values of the field variables (displacement, rotations, pore pressures,\ldots).

\subsection{Essential and natural boundary conditions}
Essential boundary conditions are conditions that are imposed explicitly on the solution and natural boundary conditions are those that automatically will be satisfied after solution of the problem.

The former class of boundary conditions involve one or more degrees of freedom and are imposed by manipulating the left hand side (LHS) of the system of equations (the side of the stiffness matrix).

The natural boundary conditions are imposed by manipulating the right hand side (RHS) of the system of equations (the side of the force vector).
