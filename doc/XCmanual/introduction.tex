\chapter{Introduction}

The ``Finite Element Analysis (FEA)'' or ``Finite Element Method (FEM)'' is a numerical method for solving problems of engineering and mathematical physics. This method has proven to be useful to solve problems with one of more of the following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
\item complicated geometries
\item complicated load patterns (in space and/or in time).
\item complicated material properties.
\end{itemize}

\section{So\ldots what's XC?}
XC is a finite element analysis program based on:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://www.python.org/}{Python}: user's programming language (\href{https://wiki.python.org/moin/boost.python}{boost.python} interface with OpenSees based C++ kernel).
  \item \href{http://opensees.berkeley.edu}{OpenSees}: finite element analysis kernel.
  \item \href{http://www.vtk.org/}{VTK}: visualization routines.
  \item \href{http://www.cgal.org/}{CGAL}: computational geometry algorithms library.
  \item \href{http://www.numpy.org/}{NumPy}: numerical computation.
  \item \href{https://www.scipy.org/}{SciPy}: scientific computing tools for Python.
  \item \href{https://www.latex-project.org/}{LaTeX}: document typesetting.
  \item \href{http://matplotlib.org/}{matplotlib}: plotting all kind of math related figures...
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Capabilities}
The main capabilities of the program are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Geometry modeling and mesh generation tools.
  \item OD, 1D, 2D and 3D elements.
  \item Linear and non-linear analysis, static and dynamic.
  \item Fiber section models (modelization of RC members,...).
  \item Activation an deactivation of elements (construction phases,...).
  \item Tools for implementing structural codes (Eurocodes, ACI, AISC,...) verifications (in progress...).
  \item Interfaces with Salome and SCIA (in progress...).
\end{itemize}

XC inherits from OpenSees its advanced capabilities for modeling and analyzing the nonlinear response of systems using a wide range of material models, elements, and solution algorithms. The analysis kernel is designed for parallel computing\footnote{The Python interface and verifications tests for these capabilities are not yet implemented.} to allow scalable simulations on high-end computers or for parameter studies.

\subsection{Model components}

The programs allows the creation of bi or three-dimensional models with 2,3 or 6 degrees of freedom. The finite element library provides 1D elements (truss and beam-column elements), 2D and 3D elements for continuum mechanics and 2D shell elements.

\subsection{Analysis}
Nonlinear analysis requires a wide range of algorithms and solution methods. XC provides nonlinear static and dynamic methods, equation solvers, and methods for handling constraints.

\section{Open source}
XC is open-source. This manual provides information about the software architecture, access to the source code, and the development process. The \href{https://opensource.org/}{open-source}\footnote{See also \href{http://www.unterstein.net/su/docs/CathBaz.pdf}{The Cathedral and the Bazaar} by Eric Raymond, which inspired Netscape's decision to release it's browser as open-source software.} movement allows researchers and users to build upon each others accomplishments using XC as community-based software.

\section{Getting started}

The natural way to get started is to download the software, compile it\footnote{Yes, for the time being there is no DEB nor RPM binary packages available.} and run some examples.

\begin{itemize}
\item Primo. Go to \href{https://github.com/lcpt/xc_basic}{xc\_basic} repository, dowload the code and follow the instructions on \href{https://github.com/lcpt/xc_basic/blob/master/install.txt}{install.txt}.
\item Secondo. Go to \href{https://github.com/lcpt/xc_utils}{xc\_utils} repository, dowload the code and follow the instructions on \href{https://github.com/lcpt/xc_utils/blob/master/install.txt}{install.txt}.
\item Tertio. Go to \href{https://github.com/lcpt/xc}{xc} repository, dowload the code and follow the instructions on \href{https://github.com/lcpt/xc/blob/master/install.txt}{install.txt}.
\item You can test some of the examples in \href{https://github.com/lcpt/xc/tree/master/verif/tests}{tests}.
\end{itemize}
