Static push-over analysis Is a simplified nonlinear analysis technique in which a structure modeled with non-linear properties (such as plastic hinge properties) and permanent gravity loads is subjected to an incremental lateral load from zero to a prescribed ultimate displacement or until the structure is unable to resist further loads. The sequence of yielding, plastic hinge formation and failure of various structural components are noted and the total force is plotted against displacement to define a capacity curve.
