Constraints verification tests
==============================

Test relative to constraint creation and removal. All the examples require constraints so simple cases are not treated here.

+ Constraints removal tests: `remove\_fix\_XX.py`.
+ Create elastic bearings: `test_elastic_bearing_XX.py`.
+ Put a fulcrum between two nodes: `test_fulcrum_01.py`.
+ Glue a node to an arbitrary position of a quad element: `test_glue_node_to_element_XX.py`.
+ Basic simulation of soil-structure interaction of a pile: `test_pile_01.py`.
+ Release of some DOF at beam end nodes: `test_release_beam_node_01.py`.
+ Simulation of rigid links between nodes: `test_huge_xxx.py` and `test_rigid_xxx.py`.
